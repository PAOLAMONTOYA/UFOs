# UFOs
### Scope
#### The purpose of this project was to create a user friendly site to be able to understand the data behind UFOs.This was done by adding the table to the main center of the page, while also creating filters to search based on specified criteria: 
- Data
- City
- State
- Country
- Shape

### Searching for Information
1. User will need to open the file by right clinking on the file and "open with" their "defualt brower"

2. User will scroll to the bottom left hand side to enter the data they wish to search and press enter on their keyboard

### Recommendations
1. When the user cannot remember the name of the city or state, it would be helpful if the filter portion could autodictate what the user might mean. Ex: if the user begins to type "c" int he city portion, the table should auto-populate the cities that have the letter "C".
2. Being able to right click on a city to provide more information on that city would be helpful. It's similar to what PowerbI does - a drillthrough portion.
